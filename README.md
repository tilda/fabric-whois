# Fabric WHOIS
A mod that allows you to see WHOIS data in Minecraft.

# How it works
Simply, a request is sent via raw sockets to the IANA WHOIS server.
From there, it's just captured and returned to the user as command output :)

# FAQ
## "Can I use this in my modpack?"
Yes. Don't ask, just use it.

## "Why is this in Fabric and not Forge?"
I wanted to tinker around with Fabric and this was the result.

## "How do I report a bug?"
Make a issue in the GitHub. (Are there even bugs in this mod? I don't know.)
